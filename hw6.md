Hi Raj,  

I hope you have a good week. I have completed the work for this week and will show it as follows.

For the newspaper website, I design the database and create a ER diagram for it as follows based on the description. For some tables like *Stories*, we might also add some extra fields like **title**,**publish_date** if needed. But the overall structure should remain the same.

For the new circulation system of a library, a basic design according to the description is given below. Here the book refers to a book entity, and more details about the book might be added (possibly to extra tables) if needed.

And for the internal employee training information, the database is designed according to the description and given below.

To copy the database, I first export the database with the following command in my terminal outside of any mysql shell
```shell
mysqldump -h 34.68.154.83 --port 10586 -u theoliao-rw -pXXXXX world > mars.sql 
```
where **XXXXX** refers to my password. Then I connect to mysql shell (in the readwrite mode) with the command 
```shell
mysql -h 34.68.154.83 --port 10586 -u theoliao-rw -pXXXXX
```
and then create the database *mars* as follows in mysql shell.
```sql
create database mars;
```
After that, I exited the mysql shell, and use the following command in the terminal to import the exported database as database *mars*.
```shell
mysql -h 34.68.154.83 --port 10586 -u theoliao-rw -pXXXXX mars < mars.sql
```
Then, the database is successfully copied, and we can use `use mars` in mysql shell and see the same tables that are in world now.
