Hi Raj,

I have already inserted 5-10 rows of sample data into the tables.

And then I select the table **Comments** in the Database **newspaper_website**, and randomly delete three rows of data with the query as follows.  
```sql
delete from newspaper_website.Comments order by rand() limit 3;
```
After that, I further update the **content** value of the last row of this table with the query as follows.  
```sql
UPDATE newspaper_website.Comments t SET t.content = 'It''s a darn shame that the facility closed after all these years!!!' order by t.ID desc limit 1;
```

All the queries are appended in the end.  

Best,  
Xinhao Liao
