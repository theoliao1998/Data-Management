Part 3: Functional Dependency Theory (15 points)
A set of attributes X is called closed (with respect to a given set of functional dependencies) if X⁺ = X.
Consider a relation with schema R(A,B,C,D) and an unknown set of functional dependencies.
For each closed attribute set below, give a set of functional dependencies that is consistent with it.

a.  none
b.  a-->b,c,d
    b-->a,c,d
    c-->a,b,d
    d-->a,b,c
c.  a-->b,c,d
    b-->c
    c-->b
    d-->a,b,c
